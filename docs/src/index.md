## What's this package for?

This package implements a particular type of approximate Bayesian inference: it approximates a posterior distribution with a full-covariance Gaussian distribution[^1]. We recommend using this package for problems with a relatively small number of parameters, 2-20 parameters perhaps.



## Basic use

Currently, the main function of interest this package exposes is `VI`.
At the very minimum, the user needs to provide a function that codes the (unnormalised) log-posterior function.

Let's consider the following toy example:
```
using GaussianVariationalInference

logp = exampleproblem1() # target log-posterior to approximate
xâ‚€ = randn(2)            # random initial mean for approximating Gaussian
q, logev = VI(logp, randn(2), S = 100, iterations = 10_000, show_every = 50)

# Plot target posterior, not log-posterior!
using Plots # must be indepedently installed.
x = -3:0.02:3
contour(x, x, map(x -> exp(logp(collect(x))), Iterators.product(x, x))', fill=true, c=:blues)

# Plot Gaussian approximation on top using red colour
contour!(x, x, map(x -> pdf(q,(collect(x))), Iterators.product(x, x))', color="red", alpha=0.2)
```

A plot similar to the one below should appear. The blue filled contours correspond to the distribution being approximated, here the exponentiated `logp`, and the red contours correspond to the produced Gaussian approximation `q`.

Option `S` above specifies the number of samples to use in order to approximate the ELBO (see [Technical background](@ref)), i.e. the objective that which maximised produces the best Gaussian approximation. The higher the value of `S` is set, the better the approximation of the ELBO, however, at a higher computational cost. The lower the value of `S` is set, the faster the method, but the poorer the approximation of the ELBO. Options `iterations` specifies the number of iterations that the internal optimiser is run when maximising the ELBO. Option `show_every` specifies how often the progress of the ELBO maximisation should be reported.
